# Hello World!

**Welcome to my zone!**.

This site is my **portfolio** and **blog** where I express myself and share my ideas, experience and knowledge.

- For [**About Me**]({% link about.md %}), it is a brief introduction to myself. You can know who I am, where I locate and what I am doing.

- For [**Resume**]({% link resume.md %}), it is a formal page about my experience. You can know my education background, my professional skills, my recent projects and my research interest.

- For [**Study Blog**]({% link _featured_categories/studylog.md %}), it is a space to share my learning progress. It breaks into four parts: Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

- For [**Tags**]({% link tags.md %}), it is a tool for quick navigation.

I hope you find the material and content useful. Any feedback is always more than welcome. 

### Enjoy your stay!
