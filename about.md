## I am ...

-  :man_technologist: **a programmer**
> Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.  -- *Linus Torvalds*

    I love coding. My dream is becoming a software engineer like [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).<br>
    I know there is still a long way to go, so what I can do now is study a little more everyday!

-  :notes: **an EDM fan**
> I had no interest in music. But now, music means everything to me. I have no words to explain how beautiful music is. It is where you can create everything, like beautiful songs to sad songs to almost anything. -- *Alan Walker*

    I love music, especially EDM, whose rhythm can create an emotional rollercoaster. 
    Sometimes I need a little more energy to get us through a stressful workday, and EDM is the right medicine for my job.

-  :earth_asia: **a traveller**
> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. –- *Lao Tzu*

    I love travelling. I would like to see the moon, the stars, and the sunset in different places around the world.
    Getting out of your comfort zone is key to unlocking our full potential!
